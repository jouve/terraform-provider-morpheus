# Morpheus Provider

The Morpheus provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Morpheus Cloud Management Platform (CMP)](https://morpheusdata.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

!> Previous versions of this provider had Morpheus SSL cert checking disabled with no
option to enable it. We've added the option to enable SSL cert checking by
setting the `secure` argument to `true` or by setting the `MORPHEUS_API_SECURE` environment
variable to `true`. The default value is `false` to maintain backwards compatibility.
We recommend enabling SSL cert checking in production environments.  A warning message will
be displayed if SSL cert checking is disabled.

## Authentication

The Morpheus provider supports a number of different methods for authenticating to Morpheus:

* [Static credentials](guides/auth.md#static-credentials)
* [Environment variables](guides/auth.md#environment-variables)

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    morpheus = {
      source  = "gomorpheus/morpheus"
      version = "0.12.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "morpheus" {
  url      = var.morpheus_url
  username = var.morpheus_username
  password = var.morpheus_password
}
```
